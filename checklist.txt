Receiver Thread is ready. Only thing missing is to implement the handler functions in App class: 
displayMessage()
playVoiceData()
handleControlMessage()

MessageSenderThread is ready. I have some doubts about the Queue. But if the queue is defined in the 
main App class i think everything will work
